- Notable difference between LMRR/LMRR-allPLOG and base for H2/O2/H2O(9%)/He
at phi=1/6.5atm, phi=3/6.5atm, phi=1/12atm, phi=3/12atm. No difference
at all between LMRR and LMRR-allPLOG
- Minor differences between LMRR and base also observed for C2H4 and C2H6

- BREAKTRHOUGH!! C3H8 has notable differences between LMRR vs LMRR-allPLOG vs base
for H2/O2/H2O(9%)/He at phi=1/6.5atm, phi=3/6.5atm, phi=1/12atm, phi=3/12atm.
- Minor differences also observed between all three for C3H6

- Differences also noticed for allyl alcohol under same conditions, but results are
highly unstable. Maybe try simming at different conditions.

-All of the same trends as above hold for an H2/O2/CO2(20%)/He mixture

-allyl alcohol deleted from fuel list because too unstable
