MERCHANT-2015 (90% diluent)
- For H2, notable difference between LMRR/LMRR-allPLOG and base for H2/O2/H2O(9%)/He
at phi=1/6.5atm, phi=3/6.5atm, phi=1/12atm, phi=3/12atm. No difference
at all between LMRR and LMRR-allPLOG
- Minor differences between LMRR and base also observed for C2H4 and C2H6

- BREAKTRHOUGH!! C3H8 has notable differences between LMRR vs LMRR-allPLOG vs base
for H2/O2/H2O(9%)/He at phi=1/6.5atm, phi=3/6.5atm, phi=1/12atm, phi=3/12atm.
- Minor differences also observed between all three for C3H6

- Differences also noticed for allyl alcohol under same conditions, but results are
highly unstable. Maybe try simming at different conditions.

-All of the same trends as above hold for an H2/O2/CO2(20%)/He mixture

-allyl alcohol deleted from fuel list because too unstable


ALZUETA
- For H2O-He sim (92% diluent), H2 has notable difference between LMRR/LMRR-allPLOG and base for H2/O2/H2O(9%)/He
at phi=1/6.5atm, phi=3/6.5atm, phi=1/12atm, phi=3/12atm. No difference
at all between LMRR and LMRR-allPLOG
- Same for NH3, but its simulation is unstable
- For NH3-He sim, similar trends observed, but some separation between the LMRR and
LMRR-allPLOG cases. Hard to tell if this separation is real or due to numerical instability

GLARBORG, STAGNI
- ditto





ADDeD FOR THE SABIA JSR SIMS;
Wang-2021
Okafor-2019
Arunthanayothin-2021


Interesting fuels:
propane, propanol, methanol, ethanol, DME, acetone, and methylamine

Mechanisms suited to these fuels:
Zhang-2018: ethanol, DME
Zhang-2016, n-heptane
Zhang-2015: n-hexane

Data sources:
Zhang-2019 (a different person): n-heptane
Hu: syngas in JSR under high CO2 diluent
Fedyaeva 2018-2019: no data points, but can use her conditions


Finally found some papers on large HC mixed with large amounts of H2:
Liu-2019: ethane and CO2 (IDT)
Xia-2020: propane and CO2 (IDT)
Zhao-2021: butane and CO2 (JSR and IDT)
Dong-2021: pentene and air (less promising) 

Need to add N- and I- forms (and maybe other isomers too) to LMRRfactory as alternatives


need to regenerate Liu because I was using 2bar instead of 2atm
also need to resim Lavadera, and this time it's crucial
